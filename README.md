# Data Analytics and Visualization with Tableau

This repository contains coursework from the Data Analytics and Visualization course, where we explored data analysis and visualization techniques using Tableau and other tools such as R/R-Studio, SAS, SPSS, and JMP/JMP Pro.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into seven modules, followed by a final project. Below is an overview of the course content:

- **Module 1**: Foundations of Information Graphics and Visualization
- **Module 2**: Data manipulation and analysis with Python (Cognition as it relates to Information Graphics and Visualization)
- **Module 3**: Data manipulation and analysis with Python (Creating Information graphics)
- **Module 4**: Data visualization in Python (Interactive Graphics)
- **Module 5**: Introduction to Tableau - data visualization and manipulation
- **Module 6**: Advanced Tableau: Interactive Visualizations and Dashboards
- **Module 7**: Tableau-Python Integration, Other Tools for data exploration

## Tools Used

- **R/R-Studio**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **SAS**: For statistical analysis and data preparation
- **SPSS**: For predictive analytics and data modeling
- **JMP/JMP Pro**: For interactive data analysis and visualization
- **Tableau**: For building dashboards and creating data visualizations

## Final Project

The final project applies the concepts learned throughout the course to a real-world dataset. The objective is to analyze and visualize key insights using Tableau and other tools as needed.

## How to Use This Repository

- Each module has its own folder containing scripts, data files, and outputs relevant to the topic covered.
- The `Final_Project` folder contains the final project's analysis, visualizations, and a report summarizing the findings.
